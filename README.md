voxelization of a tetrahedron

with thanks to u\48panda for figuring out this horrible graph: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xwr3snhelx

After noting that CT(2), CT(3), CT(5), CT(11) & CT(19) have a prime number of cubes on each layer, and having some help from u\HerissonMignion in checking that 19 is the highest value of n that produces a cubic tetrahedron [CT(n)] with this property as far as n=94,000,000, I decided to code CT(n). 

The 'context' folder in the desmos file linked above shows how cubic tetrahedra up to CT(7) were encoded into decimals, and u\48panda then assisted in coding the resulting sequence.
